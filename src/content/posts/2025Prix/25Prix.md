# 2025 World Grand Prix
## Snooker

**Snooker** is a highly accurate game of billiards that originated in England in the 19th century.  
The game is played on a standard snooker table, using a white cue ball to hit the red and coloured balls, scoring points according to specific rules and trying to get the ball into the pocket.  

Snooker emphasises skill, tactics, and psychology, requiring precise positioning and calculation to control the pace of the game.  
The **World Snooker Championship**, the **UK Championship**, and **The Masters** are the three most prestigious tournaments in snooker.

## Grand Prix

The **Grand Prix** is a former ranking snooker tournament, first established in 1984 and formerly known as the **LG Cup**, among other names.  
The Grand Prix holds a significant place in the history of snooker, having been an important stop on the professional tour and attracting many of the best players in the game.  

With a unique system of **random draws** rather than the strict seeding system used in other ranking events, the Grand Prix was **reorganised as the World Open in 2010** as part of the Snooker Tour, continuing its highly competitive nature.
