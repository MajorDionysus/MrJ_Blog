Electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important medical tool for detecting the electrical activity of the heart. Each beat of the heart is accompanied by regular electrical signal conduction, and these electrical signals produce weak potential changes on the human body surface. The electrocardiograph captures these subtle potential fluctuations through electrodes placed at different parts of the human body and converts them into visual graphics.
The waveform of the electrocardiogram contains rich information. For example, the P wave represents the depolarization process of the atrium and reflects the electrical activity of the atrium; the QRS complex corresponds to the depolarization of the ventricle, and its shape, time limit and other characteristics can indicate whether there are abnormalities in the ventricle; the T wave is related to the repolarization of the ventricle. By carefully analyzing each wave segment, interval and waveform shape of the electrocardiogram, doctors can diagnose a variety of heart diseases, such as arrhythmia, myocardial ischemia, myocardial infarction, etc. In clinical practice, whether it is daily health check-ups or the diagnosis, treatment effect evaluation and condition monitoring of patients with heart diseases, electrocardiogram plays an irreplaceable key role and provides a crucial basis for protecting human heart health.
